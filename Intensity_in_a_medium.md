# Intensity
An scalar eletrical wave is given by

$E = A \cdot \exp(i \cdot \phi)$

Where $A$ has the units of $\mathrm{V/m}$.
Quite often people refer the intensity as $I \sim |E|^2$ but more precisely, the intensity is given by

$I = c \cdot n \cdot \epsilon_0 / 2 \cdot |E|^2$

where $c$ is the speed of light in $\mathrm{m/s}$, $n$ is the refractive index in a medium and $\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \cdot 10^{âˆ’12} \mathrm{Fm^-1}$.
